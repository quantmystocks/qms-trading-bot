# How to Generate a Google App Password for Gmail SMTP

This guide will walk you through creating a Google App Password, which is required to use Gmail SMTP with this trading bot.

## Prerequisites

- A Google account (Gmail)
- Access to your Google Account settings

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Enable 2-Step Verification

1. Go to [Google Account Security](https://myaccount.google.com/security)
2. Sign in with your Google account if prompted
3. Scroll down to the **"How you sign in to Google"** section
4. Find **"2-Step Verification"** and click on it
5. If 2-Step Verification is **not enabled**:
   - Click **"Get Started"**
   - Follow the prompts to set up 2-Step Verification
   - You'll need to verify your phone number
   - Complete the setup process
6. If 2-Step Verification is **already enabled**, proceed to Step 2

> **Note:** App Passwords are only available for accounts with 2-Step Verification enabled. This is a Google security requirement.

### Step 2: Generate an App Password

1. While still in your Google Account settings, go to the **Security** page
2. Under **"How you sign in to Google"**, find **"2-Step Verification"**
3. Click on **"2-Step Verification"** (not the toggle, but the text/link)
4. Scroll down to the bottom of the 2-Step Verification page
5. Look for the **"App passwords"** section
6. Click on **"App passwords"**

   > **Note:** If you don't see "App passwords", make sure:
   > - 2-Step Verification is fully enabled
   > - You're using a personal Google account (not a Workspace account with admin restrictions)
   > - You're signed in to the correct account

7. You may be prompted to sign in again for security
8. In the **"Select app"** dropdown, choose **"Mail"**
9. In the **"Select device"** dropdown, choose **"Other (Custom name)"**
10. Type a descriptive name like **"Trading Bot"** or **"QMS Trading Bot"**
11. Click **"Generate"**

### Step 3: Copy Your App Password

1. Google will display a **16-character password** (it will look like: `abcd efgh ijkl mnop`)
2. **Copy this password immediately** - you won't be able to see it again!
3. The password will be shown with spaces, but you can copy it with or without spaces (both work)
4. Click **"Done"** to close the dialog

### Step 4: Configure Your .env File

1. Open your `.env` file in the project root
2. Set the following values:

```env
EMAIL_ENABLED=true
EMAIL_RECIPIENT=your_email@example.com
EMAIL_PROVIDER=smtp
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USERNAME=your_gmail@gmail.com
SMTP_PASSWORD=abcd efgh ijkl mnop
SMTP_FROM_EMAIL=your_gmail@gmail.com
```

**Important:**
- Replace `your_gmail@gmail.com` with your actual Gmail address
- Replace `abcd efgh ijkl mnop` with the 16-character app password you just generated
- Replace `your_email@example.com` with the email address where you want to receive notifications
- The `SMTP_USERNAME` and `SMTP_FROM_EMAIL` should be the same Gmail address
- The `EMAIL_RECIPIENT` can be any email address (doesn't have to be Gmail)

### Step 5: Test Your Configuration

Run the validation script to test your email setup:

```bash
python scripts/validate-config.py
```

Or test the connection:

```bash
python scripts/test-connection.py
```

## Troubleshooting

### "App passwords" option is not visible

**Possible causes:**
- 2-Step Verification is not fully enabled
- You're using a Google Workspace account with admin restrictions
- Your account type doesn't support app passwords

**Solutions:**
- Verify 2-Step Verification is completely set up
- Contact your Google Workspace administrator if using a work account
- Consider using a personal Gmail account or an alternative SMTP provider

### "Invalid credentials" error

**Possible causes:**
- App password was copied incorrectly
- Using your regular Gmail password instead of app password
- Extra spaces in the password

**Solutions:**
- Generate a new app password and copy it carefully
- Make sure you're using the app password, not your regular password
- Remove any extra spaces when pasting into `.env`

### "Less secure app access" error

**Note:** Google no longer supports "Less secure app access". You **must** use an App Password with 2-Step Verification enabled.

### Email not sending

**Check:**
1. Verify `EMAIL_ENABLED=true` in your `.env`
2. Check that `EMAIL_RECIPIENT` is set
3. Review application logs for specific error messages
4. Test with the connection test script

## Security Best Practices

1. **Never share your app password** - treat it like your regular password
2. **Use descriptive names** when creating app passwords (e.g., "Trading Bot - Production")
3. **Revoke unused app passwords** - if you regenerate, delete the old one
4. **Rotate app passwords periodically** - generate new ones every 6-12 months
5. **Never commit `.env` to version control** - it's already in `.gitignore`

## Alternative: Using Other Email Providers

If you prefer not to use Gmail, you can use:

- **Outlook/Hotmail**: Similar process, create app password in Microsoft Account settings
- **Brevo (Sendinblue)**: Free tier with 300 emails/day, uses API key instead
- **SendGrid**: Free tier available, uses API key
- **AWS SES**: Pay-as-you-go, very affordable for low volume

See the main README.md for configuration details for other providers.
